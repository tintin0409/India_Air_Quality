# India_Air_Quality
I. Introduction
- This project analyzes the data that includes the toxic gas and air pollutants from the atmosphere from the states of India from 1990 to 2015.
II. Challenges
-The dataset includes many missing values which requires to be replaced by the average in order to help the analysis more accurate.
III. Data File Reading Section
-This section includes all the codes for importing the dataset and packages that requires for the analysis
IV. Cleansing the dataset
-Dropping the unimportant columns that contain too many missing values
-Changing the types to uniform the format
-Handling the missing values
V. Data tables and visualizations
-Displaying the tables of graphs of the data in order to analyze better
VI. Conclusion
-Over the years, the SO2 which is toxic gas and suspended particular matter (spm) have been decreasing. However, the NO2 and rspm are increasing. It looks like Andhra Pradesh has been increasing their industry. The numers show there are more coal, gasoline, and oil burning. For the last 10 years, this state shows to have more factories, cars, and people. The state is getting more crowded and industrialized, but they did not provide the control or solution on the air polution. With the increasing of no2 and rspm, this will cost the air polution to the people who live there.
